                What is a Design? A Design for me, as a mechanical engineer student, is an outcome of my visualization of possible solutions to a given problem. Thinking back in time, designing has always been a part of my life. Unknowingly, I was introduced to designing as an infant in the process of stacking up lego blocks. It is extremely fascinating for me to think about how my skills of visualizing, innovating, and problem-solving have developed throughout my life. While designing for me a few years ago was just a way to solve problems, now, my approach towards designing is not just about solving problems, but also optimizing my solutions by considering the ineluctable factors associated with

                  <li>The Environmental,</li>
                  <li>Economical, and,</li>
                  <li>Societal impacts of design solutions.</li>
                </ul>
                The following are highlights of my journey of acquiring, instilling, and leveraging my skills as an Engineering Student at the University of Toronto.

                Using CAD and ANSYS, I will not only be able to ensure that my designed objects are safe&sturdy, but also make optimized choices of materials and dimensions for the design. The principles I have established as goals for using these tools are:
                <ul class="dfe">
                  <li>Minimizing material consumption by optimizing design dimensions - from an economic and environmental standpoint</li>
                  <li>Extending Design Lifespan- by making an adequate material choice for the design to not only meet the design functionality but also have an optimal balance of the environmental, economical, and functional facets of design. </li>
                </ul>
                As a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Toronto, some courses I have taken as a part of my Curriculum are Mechanical Design, Engineering Economics, and Design for the Environment. An amalgamation of the concepts learned in these courses will help me attain my established principles.

             <p>While solutions for moving designs were devised, how did we make them move? A concise answer is- Electronics and Energy. While energy is rudimentary for any object to move I see electronics to be a mode to channel energy to obtain the desired dynamic functionality. I must be able to create my desired energy requirements by using circuit simulation softwares such as Spice and Eagle, and by designing physical circuits with various electrical components:</p>

            <p class="dfe"> The production and use of energy are convoluted. While the material used in designing has an environmental, and economic impact as discussed before, energy use in the production/design of objects is another major factor of consideration for designing. When designing electronic and mechanical systems, it is crucial to make these systems energy efficient. Courses like Heat and Mass Transfer, Thermodynamics, and Fluid Dynamics that I have taken help me channel my thoughts toward making my designs attain the crucial principle of-The minimization of energy use.</p>

            <h3 class="fh5co-heading"> Machine Learning Projects </h3>
             <p class="dfe">To make an optimized selection of material, a vast array of material data must be analyzed and utilized for the desired application. To make systems energy-efficient, experimental data must be analyzed and utilized. While concepts of machine learning are new additions to my knowledge,  I believe ML is a valuable asset to have as an engineer in the current progressing world.</p>


            <h3 class="fh5co-heading"> Designing for a cause, design for the Environment </h3>
             <p class ="dfe">For the projects mentioned previously, ways to include Environmental, Economical, and Social considerations for designing were discussed. However, it was important to instill knowledge about evaluating designs based on these considerations. Since the beginning of the year 2022, I have been partaking in a project on the evaluation of two different oral surgical suturing techniques. Closing wounds can be done using traditional suturing using silk sutures, which must be tightened by the physician and then taken out weeks later, or alternatively, by new polyglycolic acid (PGA) absorbable sutures that dissolve over time. In this group project, our aim is to analyze the sustainability of the two options and provide a recommendation on the use of a suturing technique. The client for this project is the University Health Network (UHN).</p>

             <p class ="dfe">The primary condition of analysis of these surgical sutures is associated with their functional performance in terms of the severity of tissue reaction, the number of filaments required after wound closure, functional time duration, and the necessity of suture removal. Next, Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) for the two suturing processes were conducted. The objective of conducting these assessments is to evaluate the environmental impact of the processes occurring during the life stages of the alternative techniques.  These life stages include the production of medical equipment, the surgical procedure, and waste/extra material decommissioning. Initially, the two alternatives were thoroughly researched and compared based on a qualitative LCA analysis of the inputs and outputs (or residues) for the processes occurring during the life stage of the suturing techniques. To reinforce the qualitative LCA analysis, quantitative data was researched and the environmental impacts of these suturing techniques were compared using tools such as openLCA.</p>
             
             <p class ="dfe">Absorbable PGA sutures scored considerably higher on the overall suture functionality. I believe this is due to the low tissue reactivity of absorbable sutures since PGA is biodegradable through hydrolysis only, and therefore it does not interfere with bodily processes. Moreover, Absorbable sutures also proved to have a lower environmental impact as compared to traditional silk sutures. I found the obtained results to be reasonable due to the following reasons:
               <ol class ="dfe">
                <li>While PGA sutures are manufactured in the US, silk sutures are exported all the way from China. Transportation of silk sutures uses significantly higher amounts of fuel and therefore has higher emissions. </li>
                <li>The traditional suturing process requires the removal and decommissioning of sutures. To be concise, the traditional suturing process not only has an extra life stage with major environmental stressor processes (ie. incineration of medical waste) but also requires double the amount of medical equipment sterilization rounds for medical equipment. </li>
               </ol>
             </p>
            
           <p class ="dfe"> UHN seeks the recommendation of one of the alternatives that are the most sustainable. However, UHN’s consideration of environmental sustainability is balanced simultaneously with the consideration of the organization's profitability for choosing an alternative. Inferring from the economic analysis of the alternative suturing techniques, Absorbable PGA sutures not only have a more expensive production process but also have patients incur higher costs.</p>

             <p class ="dfe"> Since the decision of choosing a suturing technique will also be affected by the response of consumers (or patients), a Societal Analysis of the alternative suturing techniques is required. The analysis entails the facets of biological implications of using dissolvable and non-dissolvable suture materials. For instance, possible temporary reactions of suture materials on wounds may affect a patient's preference for a suturing technique. Lastly, since a vast array of data is being researched and analyzed to compare the alternatives, possible points of uncertainty in the analysis above using the methods mentioned were justified as a part of a Sensitivity Analysis.

             <p class ="dfe">Overall, a combination of all the insights I have gained through doing these projects help me channel my designing abilities towards a prudent use of resources in order to maximize benefits for society and minimize impacts on the environment.
